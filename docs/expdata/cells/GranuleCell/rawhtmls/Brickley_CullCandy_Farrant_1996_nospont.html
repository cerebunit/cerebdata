J Physiol (Lond) 497:753-759. PMID 9003560</td></tr><tr><th>data_collection</th><td>There is no direct description in the paper. But this paper is cited in D'Angelo et al 2001 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.21-03-00759.2001 and this data collection is based off Fig3A in Brikley et al's paper. Focussing on the voltage trace of current clamp on control rats (not when blockers were used, lower trace is with Bisculline) you do not see any spiking prior to the first current injection of 6pA (increased in steps). From this figure and the paragraph preceeding the Discussion section we get, n = 4 cells, P21 rats and set 0 +/- 0 Hz</td></tr><tr><th>units</th><td>Hz</td></tr><tr><th>validation_info</th><td>This is the experimental data demonstrating no spontaneous firing of in-vitro 4 GranularCells from P14 Sprague-Dawley rats.</td></tr><tr><th>mean</th><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><th>protocol</th><td>Whole-cell recording: Sprague-Dawley rats were killed by decapitation and parasaggital slices (150-200 um) cut from the cerebellum. Patch-pipettes were pulled from thick-walled glass coated with Sylgard and had 5-10 Mohm resistance. The pipette solution contained (mM): CsCl, 140; NaCl, 4; CaCl2, 0.5; Hepes, 10; EGTA, 5; Mg-ATP, 2 (adjusted to pH 7.3 with CsOH). The bathing solution contained (mM): NaCl, 125; KCl, 2.5; CaCl2, 2; MgCl2, 1; NaHCO3, 26; NaH2PO4, 1.25; glucose, 25 (pH 7.4 with 95% O2 and 5% CO2). No correction was made for the estimated liquid junction potential of 3.9 mV (calculated from the Generalised Henderson equation using Axoscope 1.1; Axon Instruments). Current recordings were obtained at 22-25 C. Input resistance, series resistance and cell capacitance were determined from the current response to a 10 mV hyperpolarizing voltage step; currents were filtered at 50 kHz (-3 dB, 4-pole Bessel filter) and digitized at 200 kHz. Series resistance (25-40 Mohm) and capacitance (2.6-3.7pF) were similar at all ages. Input resistance decreased significantly with age, from 11.2 +/- 1.9 Gohm at P7 (n = 28) to 4.6 +/- 1.4 Gohm at P21 (n = 10). All other data were stored on digital audiotape (DC to 20 kHz). For analysis, currents were filtered at 2 kHz (-3 dB, 8-pole Bessel filter) and digitized at 10 kHz. Synaptic currents were identified visually. The holding current and current variance for each record was calculated from a 200 ms epoch containing no synaptic events. Charge transfer resulting from tonic GABA_A receptor activation was calculated from the measured conductance in the absence and presence of bicuculline. Charge transfer via PSCs (post synaptic currents) was calculated from the integral of their averaged waveforms and their mean frequency. Perforated-patch recording with gramicidin: To avoid altering the normal intracellular Cl- concentration during current-clamp recordings these were made using the gramicidinperforated-patch technique. The pipette solution contained (mM): KCl, 145; Hepes, 10; EGTA, 5; CaCl2, 0.1 (pH 7-3 with KOH). Pipettes were tip-filled with this solution then back-filled with one containing 6-9 ug/ml gramicidin. Series resistance was continuously monitored in voltageclamp mode and the switch to current clamp (I_fast setting, Axopatch 200A) was made once this was &lt; 100 Mohm (20-60 min after forming seal). No correction was made for the estimated liquid junction potential of 3.3 mV. Except where stated, all current-clamp recordings were obtained in the absence of glutamate and glycine receptor antagonists. All values are expressed as the mean + S.E.M. Statistical comparisons were made using Student's t test and nonparametric randomization or sign tests; differences were considered significant at P &lt; 0 05.</td></tr><tr><th>standard_deviation</th><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><th>sample_size</th><td>4</td></tr></table></body>
