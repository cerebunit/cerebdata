Granule cell resting membrane potential measured soon after gaining access to the cell was -57.8 +/- 6.4 mV (n = 43; range from -45 to -72 mV).

Cerebellar slices were obtained from 21- to 31-day-old Wistar rats (day of birth = 1). RECORDING AND ANALYSIS: Patch pipettes were pulled from thick-walled borosilicate glass capillaries and had 8-12 Mohm resistance before seal formation. Electrical stimulation of afferent fibres was performed with a bipolar tungsten electrode via a stimulus insulation unit. In some experiments, a second stimulating electrode was located at the edge of the molecular layer. Stimulating pulses lasting 100-200 us were usually delivered at 0.25 Hz. Tight-seal whole-cell recordings were performed conventionally using the 'blind patch' approach. Membrane current and voltage were recorded using an Axopatch-ID patch-clamp amplifier with output cut-off frequency = 10 kHz. Signals were simultaneously stored on a DAT recorder and fed to a PC at sampling frequency = 250 us for current-clamp recordings, 10-50 us for voltage-clamp recordings. Data were reported as means + S.D. and the number of observations is indicated in parentheses. Statistical comparisons were done using Student's t test. Analysis of current transients activated by 10-20 mV hyperpolarizing steps from the holding potential of -70 mV in voltage-clamp mode gave the following values (n = 79 for all measures): membrane input resistance Rm = 2.3 +/- 1.1 Gohm, membrane input capacitance Cm = 3.1 +/- 1.5 pF, membrane time constant Tm= RmCm = 6.7 +/- 3.3 ms, decay time constant of the current transient tau_s = 57.9 +/- 24 us, series resistance Rs, = tau_s/Cm = 18.5 +/- 15.6 Mohm. In current-clamp mode, electrode capacitance compensation was critical in recording membrane voltage changes reliably, since granule cell membrane capacitance (3 pF) was comparable to electrode capacitance (5 pF). Electrode capacitance was compensated electronically using the value matched during current transient cancellation in cell-attached configuration. Cancellation achieved by maintaining the immersion depth to 1 mm or less and holding the electrode at a rather steep angle (45-60 deg) was virtually complete and no effective improvement was obtained after having reduced the electrode capacitive current with Sylgard coating. The current charging the patch-pipette was provided by the feed-back 'negative capacitance' compensation circuit in the Axopatch-ID amplifier. Note that capacitive compensation currents, due to their dependence on the rate of membrane potential change, are much greater during action potentials than during the EPSPs. Nearly maximal compensation was usually achieved, since &lt;10% overcompensation invariably produced oscillations. On the other hand, decreasing negative capacitance compensation slowed membrane charging considerably. ERROR ESTIMATES: Pipette offset was compensated electronically. Since liquid junction potential was &lt;2 mV, membrane potential values were left uncorrected. Field potentials produced by neighbouring granule cell activity, which were measured after removing the pipette from the cell and cleaning its tip by gently applying positive pressure, were smaller than 0.5 mV (n = 8) and therefore did not appreciably modify the transmembrane potential. Attenuation of a constant command potential across the electrode resistance (Re = 10 Mohm) was calculated by considering current partitioning between the seal leak resistance (R1 &gt;20 Gohm) and cell input resistance (either Rm = 0.5 Gohm or Rm = 5 Gohm to simulate inward rectification), according to the equation Vp/ Ve = 1 - [Re(Rm + Ri)/RmR]. Attenuation of Vp caused by the voltage drop across the access resistance (Ra = R, - Re = 10 Mohm) was obtained as Vm/Vp = 1 - [Ra/Rm]. With the resistance values given, the membrane potential ratio Vm/Vc was &gt;0.94 for Rm = 0.5 Gohm and &gt; 0.996 for Rm= 5 Gohm. Consistent with negligible voltage attenuation, bridge compensation did not produce any appreciable changes in EPSPs or passive voltage transients (n = 11). Attenuation of a potential generated by mossy fibre synapses at the end of the dendrites and measured from the soma was estimated using a neuron model consisting of a spherical soma (diameter = 6 um) connected to four identical unbranched dendrites (diameter = 1 um, length = 10 um) and an axon (diameter = 0.1 um). The procedure used is based on cable's equations. Computations were carried out using a specific axoplasmic resistance of 80 ohm cm and a specific membrane resistance of either 1500 ohm cm2 or 15000 ohm cm2 to simulate inward rectification. In the absence of synaptic inputs, soma-to-dendritic membrane potential ratios were 0.981 and 0.998, respectively. When an active load of 500 pS (which is a reasonable estimate of synaptic conductance) was applied to one to four dendrites, calculations yielded soma-to-dendritic membrane potential ratios of 0.977, 0.972, 0.967 and 0.962, respectively (Rm = 0.5 Gohm), and 0.993, 0.988, 0.983 and 0.978, respectively (Rm = 5 Gohm). Therefore, in current-clamp as well as in voltage-clamp conditions, the granule cells tend to behave like a single electrical compartment.
