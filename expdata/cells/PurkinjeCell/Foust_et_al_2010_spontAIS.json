    "data_collection": "The data given in the paper are freq.range = 23 to 105 Hz and n = 4cells. No mean or median was given so lets assume median=41Hz ((23+105)/2). This results in three statistics. From 10.1186/1471-2288-14-135 and considering this three statistic scenario, Zeta1 = {a, m, b; n} = {23, 41, 105; 4} the estimated xbar = (a+2m+b)/4 + (1-2m+b)/4n = 55Hz.

    "notes": "Experimentalists claim n=15cells. Fig.2E shows 7 red diamond and 4 blue diamond, both with current injections. 4 'x' for spontaneous firing from AIS (axon initial segment). Thus, n=4cells for testing spontaneous firing."
